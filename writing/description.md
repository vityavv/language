# Project description

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an Interpreted, Turing Complete programming language in order to find out how interpreted programming languages are made and how they work, and what it takes to be Turing Complete.

### Method
This language will be created using JavaScript as it is the tool I am most proficient in using. I will use Node.JS with no modules.

### End goal
To make an interpreted programming language that has all of the functions and features it needs to be turing complete.
