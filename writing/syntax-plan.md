# Plan for syntax
This is the plan for language's syntax

### All commands are space separated

### Comments start with a #

##### Anything marked with (!) will be changed when improvements are made
```
print "string" # print something
print 5 + 10, "hello " # params are seperated by commas
var x = 5 # make x be 5
var x = 10 # in this language, you must type var before any variable declaration, definition, and change
if 5 == x then # if ... then ... fi
	print "x is 5" # indentation is *optional*
fi
# there are 2 types - number and string (! - add arrays?)
# string + num = "<string><num>"
# string + string = "<string><string>"
# string / string or string - string or string * string = ERROR
# string * num = that string repeated num times
```
